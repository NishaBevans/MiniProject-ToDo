This is a simple ToDo appliication that allows you to add important tasks you have throughout the day. After loading the application, just select '1' in the command line to add any task to your list.
To view all the tasks in your list, simply input '2' into the command line and all your tasks will appear, as well as an ✗ next to incompleted tasks, or a ✓ for completed tasks.
In order to mark a task as completed, all you need to do is input '3' into your command line, and then enter the number of the task.
Deleting a task is just as simple! Just enter '4'. Then enter the number of the task you wish to delete.
If you are finished with the application, '5' is your exit strategy!
